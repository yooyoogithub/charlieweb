  From a <a href="http://www.naver.com">cross-cultural</a> perspective the equation between
  public leadership and dominance <br>is questionable. What does
  one mean by ‘dominance’? Does it indicate coercion? <p>Or
  control over ‘the most valued’? ‘Political’ systems may be
  about both, either, or conceivably neither. The idea of
  ‘control’ would be a bothersome one for many peoples, as
  for instance among many native peoples of Amazonia where
  all members of a community are fond of their personal
  autonomy and notably allergic to any obvious expression of
  control or coercion. </p>

  <p>The conception of political power as a
  coercive force, while it may be a Western fixation, is not a
  universal. It is very unusual for an Amazonian leader to give
  an order.</p> <p style="margin-top:45px;">If many peoples do not view
  political power as a coercive force, nor as the most valued domain, then
  the leap from ‘the political’ to ‘domination’ (as coercion), and from
  there to ‘domination of women’, is a shaky one. </p> As Marilyn
  Strathern has remarked, the notions of ‘the political’ and
  ‘political personhood’ are cultural obsessions of our own, a
  bias long reflected <br>in anthropological constructs.
